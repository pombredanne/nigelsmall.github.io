<h2>Geoff</h2>

<p>Geoff is a text-based interchange format for <a href="http://neo4j.org/">Neo4j</a> graph data that should be
instantly readable to anyone familiar with
<a href="http://www.neo4j.org/learn/cypher">Cypher</a>, on which its syntax is based.</p>


<h3>Implementations</h3>

<p>There have been three Geoff parser-loader implementations, each based on a
slightly different variant of the format. The most recent version, described
on this page and designed for Neo4j 2.0 and upwards, is represented by a new
Neo4j server extension called <a href="load2neo">load2neo</a>.</p>

<p>An earlier server plugin, <a href="https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-geoff">neo4j-geoff</a>,
is also compatible with Neo4j 2.0 (thanks to generous assitance from
<a href="https://twitter.com/peterneubauer">Peter Neubauer</a>) but does not
provide support for labels, unlike load2neo. A client side parser-loader also
exists in <a href="http://book.py2neo.org/en/latest/geoff/">py2neo</a>.
This also has no label support and, due to its use of the REST API, is somewhat
less scalable than the server extensions. A demo of the XML to Geoff
conversion tool, distributed with py2neo, can be seen at <a href="http://api.nigelsmall.com/xml-geoff">http://api.nigelsmall.com/xml-geoff</a>.</p>

<h3>Syntax Overview</h3>

<p>A Geoff document is composed of one or more subgraphs, separated by the <code>~~~~</code> sequence. Each subgraph consists of one or more paths, each containing a number of nodes and relationships. For example:</p>

<pre>
(alice {"name":"Alice"})
(bob {"name":"Bob"})
(carol {"name":"Carol"})
(alice)<-[:KNOWS]->(bob)<-[:KNOWS]->(carol)<-[:KNOWS]->(alice)
</pre>

<h3>Nodes</h3>

<p>Each node can have an identifier, a set of labels and a set of associated properties. None of these attributes are mandatory though, and in the simplest case, a node may just be an empty set of parentheses: <code>()</code>. The examples below show some of the combinations possible:</p>

<pre>
(a)
(b {"name":"Bob"})
(cat:Animal)
(dog:Animal {"name":"dog"})
(dinner:Spam:Egg:Chips {"foo":"bar","answer":42})
</pre>

<h3>Relationships</h3>

<p>Any number of nodes may be chained together in a path using relationships, drawn as in Cypher.</p>

<h3>Properties</h3>

<p>Properties are represented in JSON format and may be provided in single nodes, in longer paths or in both:</p>

<pre>
(alice {"name":"Alice"})
(bob {"name":"Bob"})
(alice {"age":33})<-[:KNOWS]->(bob {"age":44})
</pre>

<h3>Hooks</h3>

<p>When a subgraph is loaded into a database, new nodes and relationships are generally created. In some instances, it is desirable to use an existing node instead. In such cases, a hook can be used to bind a node to an existing one with the same label, key and value. If none is found, one will be created; if more than one is found, one will be chosen.</p>

<p>Hooks are enclosed within colons and use a heavy arrow (<code>=&gt;</code>) to bind them to a node within the subgraph. The subgraph below shows one hook and three new nodes.</p>

<pre>
:Person:name:=>(alice:Person {"name":"Alice"})
(alice)-[:KNOWS]->(bob:Person {"name":"Bob"})
(alice)-[:KNOWS]->(carol:Person {"name":"Carol"})
(alice)-[:KNOWS]->(dave:Person {"name":"Dave"})
</pre>


<h3>Full Syntax Specification</h3>

<p>A full specification for the Geoff syntax is described below:</p>

<pre>
document       := subgraph (_ boundary _ subgraph)*
boundary       := "~~~~"

subgraph       := [element (_ element)*]
element        := comment | hook | path

comment        := "/*" &lt;&lt;any text excluding sequence "*/"&gt;&gt; "*/"

hook           := ":" ~ label [~ ":" ~ key] ~ ":" "=&gt;" node

path           := node (forward_path | reverse_path)*
forward_path   := "-" relationship "-&gt;" node
reverse_path   := "&lt;-" relationship "-" node

node           := named_node | anonymous_node
named_node     := "(" ~ node_name [_ label_list] [_ property_map] ~ ")"
anonymous_node := "(" ~ [label_list] [_ property_map] ~ ")"
relationship   := "[" ~ ":" type [_ property_map] ~ "]"
label_list     := (":" label)+
label          := name | JSON_STRING
property_map   := "{" ~ [key_value (~ "," ~ key_value)* ~] "}"
node_name      := name | JSON_STRING
name           := (ALPHA | DIGIT | "_")+
type           := name | JSON_STRING
key_value      := key ~ ":" ~ value
key            := name | JSON_STRING
value          := array | JSON_STRING | JSON_NUMBER | JSON_BOOLEAN | JSON_NULL

array          := empty_array | string_array | numeric_array | boolean_array
empty_array    := "[" ~ "]"
string_array   := "[" ~ JSON_STRING (~ "," ~ JSON_STRING)* ~ "]"
numeric_array  := "[" ~ JSON_NUMBER (~ "," ~ JSON_NUMBER)* ~ "]"
boolean_array  := "[" ~ JSON_BOOLEAN (~ "," ~ JSON_BOOLEAN)* ~ "]"

* Mandatory whitespace is represented by "_" and optional whitespace by "~"
</pre>

<h3>Why "Geoff"?</h3>

<p>Geoff is a contrived acronym standing for Graph Export Object File Format.
More importantly, it was the name of my grandfather who gave me my first
computer, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_32/64">Dragon 32</a>, in 1983.</p>
